<p> This is a simple, static data portal primarily meant for internal Brigade data sharing and storage.</p>
<h3> Who can add datasets?</h3>
<p>Anyone added to Open Savannah's <a href="http://github.com/opensavannah">GitHub organization</a> should be able to automatically log in as an administrator by selecting `Log in` from the top right. Only members of the Open Savannah GitHub org have administrative privileges, but, upon request, we will be happy to add you to the GitHub organization so that you can upload new datasets. Simply email yall@opensavannah.org with the subject line "REQUEST TO JOIN OPEN SAVANNAH GITHUB ORG" and your GitHub username in the body of the email.</p>
